The airman\'s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil.

That\'s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective.
